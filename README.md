# TensorFlow-CNN-Dogs-Vs-Cats-Kaggle
A CNN model for the classification of the cats and dogs images
The dataset is available in Kaggle
Tried a CNN model without regularization techniques such as BatchNormalisation and Dropout
Then tried with the dropout and batchnormalisation layers and compared the accuracy
Plotted the accuracy curve and Loss curve for training and validation
